        I have had my Apple AirPods V1 for 2 years now (oh so hipster of me I know) and they’re the best thing I never expected to love. I will get into my relationship with my AirPods in another post in a few weeks as I’m thinking about getting the V2 as my current V1 are so full of ear wax that the sound is so low (disgusting I know). So anyway, within the 2 years I have owned the beloved earphones I have also been cycling and have been quite active. I cycle to and from work every day and also to the gym and pretty much anywhere I need to go as I don’t drive. So in a week, I could cycle around 130km and with every cycle, I listen to podcasts. I know you shouldn’t cycle with earphones in but I only put the left one in (the opposite side to traffic in Ireland) and the volume is low enough that I can hear everything around me. It’s just nice to have something to listen to and ponder while I’m on my 40-minute commute. I also believe that you should be learning something new everyday through either reading or audio so you know 2 birds 1 stone and all that. Let’s get down to it, I love my AirPods but I don’t trust them. I have seen many people exercising with them in, whether it’s running, lifting weights or cycling but for me, they aren’t my go-to. When I sweat the AirPods are less secure in my ear, I am constantly adjusting them so in time I just went back to my over the head non-brand wireless headphones I got from Wish (probably the best things I’ve ever bought off of that company). For cycling, I’ve never even tried to use them because if one was to fall out while I was weaving in and out of the Dublin traffic it would be run over or lost down a drain in no time. So my solution at first was these; They’re an around the neck ear cuff accessory for the AirPods. They were £16.99 (in pounds because there is no Irish Amazon site so we have to use the UK one, it’s very annoying) on Amazon (no longer available). You just slip them in the two holders and wrap the cuff around your ear and you’re good. Again, I would only use one and with time and wear and tear my AirPods were getting quieter and quieter and eventually needed to be angled at a certain way for you to hear anything so this accessory no longer met my requirements. After a year of using the ear cuff accessory, I decided to switch it up and I got something that changed the experience I had with my AirPods completely and they’re only £4.49 on Amazon. I bought them on a whim and I have not regretted it. They are something that I could not live without alongside my AirPods. This may all seem very dramatic for a piece of silicon but I absolutely love them. They are simply just silicone covers with ear hooks. These simple little things make it feel as if you have nothing in your ear while giving you the sense of security that no matter what you aren’t going to lose one of your €179+ earphones. I know there is a lot of negativity around AirPod accessories as some people think you shouldn’t have to buy an accessory for them they should just work. And they do. AirPods just works just like your phone it just works but you still aren’t going to walk around with it naked and if you are you’re crazy or have a lot of money. No, you’re going to put a case on your phone which falls under the category of accessory. So, just because a product might require an accessory to better its experience doesn’t make that a bad product. With 2 days left in the month, I currently have 26h 1m and 406.6km done on my Strava. That’s ~26hours this month that I have used these silicon covers alongside my AirPods and I don’t know what I would do without them. They have made my daily commute so much simpler that all I have to do is grab the left AirPod from its case, slip it into the cover, stick it in my ear and go without any worries or adjusting on my ride. So, if you’re an avid AirPods user and are constantly adjusting the position as you walk or exercise I highly recommend buying these covers, for the little cost they make such a difference.
