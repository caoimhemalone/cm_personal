        Everything happens for a reason. I got shit on by a bird this morning. I was awoken this morning like I am every morning of the weekday to the sound of Alexa's voice coming from my Amazon Echo Dot, she was telling me the current weather at 7:09 am. I usually anticipate the rain or the cold and then go back to sleep until 7:30 am but this morning she told me it was -2 degrees Celsius and I got out of bed immediately. There was no way I was getting up at 7:30 and cycling, it would have been too dangerous with the frost on the roads. So, I quickly got dressed, grabbed my toothbrush to brush my teeth in work, as I had no time, and caught my dad before he left for work. I drove with him as far as the North Circular Road and then hopped out at the traffic lights to continue my journey to work ( a 30-minute walk). Just as I turned the corner heading towards the 5 Lamps a bird pooed on me! Luckily, not on my head, it was just on the arm of my coat. It’s meant to be good luck when a bird poos on you but so far my day hasn’t been very lucky it’s been average. I don’t know if I believe in luck. I feel we create our luck ourselves. For instance, when people say; ‘Oh, I was so lucky to get that job’, no you worked hard and built up a portfolio or a skill which in turn helped you get that job. We hate giving ourselves praise (well, most of us) so we play it off like it was nothing that we have done, it was just an accident. We, as humans, shy away from the fact that we could be good or great at something so we label it down to Lady Luck being on our side and hope that we don't mess it up. But in truth, we must have portrayed ourselves well in our job interviews or first dates or presentations to get the job, the relationship or the grade and that doesn't come down to luck it comes down to hard work, which in turn is a reflection of your personality or your skills. I guess I don’t believe in luck because I’m too practical. I think of everything logically. I’m a developer it’s how my brain works. I don’t believe in luck but I do believe in ‘everything happens for a reason’. I do believe that the Universe works in magical ways. If my auntie never bought me that digital camera when I was 12 I would never have brought it to Florida on holidays with me and taken pictures (very very bad ones) and sparked the photography light inside of me. Further on, then I wouldn’t have taken photos on my mam’s iPhone 4s a few years later which led me to post more photography pictures on Instagram which wouldn’t of led me to taking photos in San Francisco and the next trip and the next which wouldn’t of led me to this year actually getting paid to take photos for Bodynamics, a gym nearby. There are so many situations like that in my life that I look back on. What if this never happened or that never happened or what if I did end up going to college in New York for film studies like I was researching at the time, my life would be so much different now. Everything happens for a reason, that’s the good times and the bad it just depends on your outlook on life.
