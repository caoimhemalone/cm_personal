                            With Apple's release of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro this month I thought I’d dive into why I don’t see myself leaving Apple. At 24 I am on iPhone number 4 (iPhone  5, 6, 7, XS), that’s not exactly a high number but every second year since I was 17 I bought a new iPhone and renewed my 2-year contract with Three without hesitation. I have not always paid for my bill so that might have a factor in being able to get a new iPhone every second year. When I was 17 myself and my sister made a presentation on Keynote, sat my parents down and made points as to why they should get us an iPhone (Looking back now it makes us sound so spoiled). My parents were reluctant but we kept persisting we even changed my Mam's lock screen of her iPhone 4 to the new iPhone 5. After we hounded them for months my mam decided that we could get them. Because she was on a work contract she wasn’t paying her phone bill herself so she decided that she would pay for ours instead. She also liked the idea of us never running out of credit in an emergency because it was bill pay we could always call her. I think she paid the few hundred for each phone too. After that we would pay the €300-500 whatever it was for the phone and my mam would pay the bill. Until I got my iPhone XS. I was just graduated from college, in a full-time job and decided to buy myself a Christmas present. I paid around €600 for the phone and for the first time my phone bill myself. And ever since I have never even considered any other brand of phone. So why no matter the cost do I keep going back to Apple again and again? I have the first generation iPad, 2nd gen Apple TV, I had gen 0 Apple Watch and last summer upgraded to gen 4, Airpods 1, I have a 2015 iMac, a dinosaur 2008 iMac (now used mainly as a photos slideshow), I have the 2012 MacBook Pro (extremely slow and only used for Netflix) and recently thanks to my way too generous boyfriend I have the 2018 MacBook Air. This may make me sound like I’m made of money but these were all accumulated over the past 10 years. I like to save up my money to buy expensive technology and I’m an Apple Nerd so I happily give them all of my hard-earned money. But why? Why do I give this trillion-dollar company all of my money? Because I believe in them. I believed in Steve Jobs. He wasn’t perfect by any means but there was a method to his madness. Without him being anal about designs he wouldn’t have revolutionised certain products. Like the swivel neck iMac or the first iPad or how the floors and windows looked in his Apple Stores. I think my belief in what he built and what Apple is today is why I am so blindly devoted to the company. If I hadn’t of been so inspired by Steve Jobs when I was 15 then I probably wouldn’t have gone on to do Computer Science in college and wouldn’t have my career today in Web Development (can you call it a career when you’re only 1 year graduated from college?). If I didn’t mess around in iMovie with my families 2008 iMac I would never have gotten into film editing and photography later on as a hobby. Apple has made me the person that I am. No, seriously, it has. That is why I think I will never veer away from their products. Every time an Android user complains about Apples walled garden I just brush it off and continue to give my support to my favourite company. Every time someone makes a joke about the headphone jack I tell them of how AirPods are the best product that I’ve ever bought and that I’m about to buy my second pair. Every time someone gives out about the price or how Apple is late to the party with some features I know that’s it’s because perfection takes time and that I’d rather pay €1000-2000 for the aluminium to have a long-lasting laptop (my 2012 MacBook Pro is still kicking in her old age). Every time I watch a YouTuber buy a new Windows laptop because Apple took away the ports I know that in a few years those same people will be rocking USB C everything. I believe that they thrive to make the best products that they can without forcing a project out that isn't perfect (cough cough Galaxy Fold) and they give you something that you didn't even realise that you wanted until you had it. The Floppy Disk reader under the screen. A device that allowed you to listen to 1000s of songs and fits in your pocket. A phone with no physical keyboard. A tablet which fit perfectly between your two hands. A laptop that could fit inside an a4 envelope. A watch with a computer inside. A phone with no headphone jack. Wireless earphones. A phone with 2 cameras on the back. A phone with 3 cameras on the back. And that's just the hardware. Apple has given us so many features over the years in their Software that we just wouldn't have used or known that we wanted to use them unless Apple had taken the initiative to give us those features. They know their users so well and in return have so much loyalty from their users. So yes I am probably way too loyal to Apple but I wouldn’t have it any other way. I join countless other people who count down the days to WWDC, who sit outside Apple Stores for days waiting for the new iPhone, who save up all of their extra money to buy the newest Apple Products because we just need to have them! We're Apple fangirls/boys devoted to the company that has touched us all in different ways. The reason why I won't leave them is simple; everything just works.

                            I have had my Apple AirPods V1 for 2 years now (oh so hipster of me I know) and they’re the best thing I never expected to love. I will get into my relationship with my AirPods in another post in a few weeks as I’m thinking about getting the V2 as my current V1 are so full of ear wax that the sound is so low (disgusting I know). So anyway, within the 2 years I have owned the beloved earphones I have also been cycling and have been quite active. I cycle to and from work every day and also to the gym and pretty much anywhere I need to go as I don’t drive. So in a week, I could cycle around 130km and with every cycle, I listen to podcasts. I know you shouldn’t cycle with earphones in but I only put the left one in (the opposite side to traffic in Ireland) and the volume is low enough that I can hear everything around me. It’s just nice to have something to listen to and ponder while I’m on my 40-minute commute. I also believe that you should be learning something new everyday through either reading or audio so you know 2 birds 1 stone and all that. Let’s get down to it, I love my AirPods but I don’t trust them. I have seen many people exercising with them in, whether it’s running, lifting weights or cycling but for me, they aren’t my go-to. When I sweat the AirPods are less secure in my ear, I am constantly adjusting them so in time I just went back to my over the head non-brand wireless headphones I got from Wish (probably the best things I’ve ever bought off of that company). For cycling, I’ve never even tried to use them because if one was to fall out while I was weaving in and out of the Dublin traffic it would be run over or lost down a drain in no time. So my solution at first was these; They’re an around the neck ear cuff accessory for the AirPods. They were £16.99 (in pounds because there is no Irish Amazon site so we have to use the UK one, it’s very annoying) on Amazon (no longer available). You just slip them in the two holders and wrap the cuff around your ear and you’re good. Again, I would only use one and with time and wear and tear my AirPods were getting quieter and quieter and eventually needed to be angled at a certain way for you to hear anything so this accessory no longer met my requirements. After a year of using the ear cuff accessory, I decided to switch it up and I got something that changed the experience I had with my AirPods completely and they’re only £4.49 on Amazon. I bought them on a whim and I have not regretted it. They are something that I could not live without alongside my AirPods. This may all seem very dramatic for a piece of silicon but I absolutely love them. They are simply just silicone covers with ear hooks. These simple little things make it feel as if you have nothing in your ear while giving you the sense of security that no matter what you aren’t going to lose one of your €179+ earphones. I know there is a lot of negativity around AirPod accessories as some people think you shouldn’t have to buy an accessory for them they should just work. And they do. AirPods just works just like your phone it just works but you still aren’t going to walk around with it naked and if you are you’re crazy or have a lot of money. No, you’re going to put a case on your phone which falls under the category of accessory. So, just because a product might require an accessory to better its experience doesn’t make that a bad product. With 2 days left in the month, I currently have 26h 1m and 406.6km done on my Strava. That’s ~26hours this month that I have used these silicon covers alongside my AirPods and I don’t know what I would do without them. They have made my daily commute so much simpler that all I have to do is grab the left AirPod from its case, slip it into the cover, stick it in my ear and go without any worries or adjusting on my ride. So, if you’re an avid AirPods user and are constantly adjusting the position as you walk or exercise I highly recommend buying these covers, for the little cost they make such a difference.

                            This started off as a journal entry but I decided that it was actually a good topic to write about. I’ve been thinking a lot about the 5am club. I’ve heard about it on many podcasts and have read numerous medium articles on the subject. I would 100% join the 5am club instead of staying up until 11:30 doing my side job of web dev or editing a video (which I rarely have time to do anymore). But right now in my life it’s just not ideal to get up at 5am. Yeah it would be great by the time I get into work at 8:30 I can have my gym workout done, a bit of web development done, my breakfast eaten nice and early to get my metabolism going and my 10km cycle to work done. I could have a really productive day before 9am. But there’s just one problem. It would take a huge toll on my relationship with my boyfriend. Our weekdays are so busy that we only get to talk to each other via text in the evening (and then we see each other on the weekend). And even at that the conversation is spread out because we aren’t looking at our phones the whole evening. We don’t live together so it makes catching up on eachothers day a little bit harder. So if I woke up at 5am I would have to go to sleep at 9pm to get my 8 hours sleep ( I need my 8 hours or I can’t function). And I just can’t do that right now. But my current routine does work for me. My Daily (weekday) Routine I wake up at 7:09 am to the sound of Alexa telling me the weather for the day (essential when living in Ireland and cycling to work). Then my alarm goes off at 7:10am indicating that it’s time to get out of bed. I eat a banana, that I bring to my room the night before, and get dressed into my gym/cycling gear. I brush my teeth then go downstairs and grab my lunch from the fridge. I put on everything I need to cycle (jacket, gloves, helmet, turn lights on) then leave the house around 7:30–7:45. I cycle 10km (40minutes) from Santry, Dublin to Leeson Street, Dublin. I get into work (a web development company) for 8:10–8:20, have a shower and get into my work clothes (the typical Developer attire of jeans and a hoodie) then I am at my desk by 8:30/40. Around 9am I will have my porridge (porridge oats, milk, peanut butter, chia seeds, and protein powder) It’s the best porridge ever. Then I work until 5pm. I’m back on the bike at 5:15pm, cycle 8.4km to the gym, do an hours workout, cycle ~2km home, get home around 7:15, have my dinner, shower or have a bath to relax my muscles while I read a book, then some days I sit down at my computer and work on my side hustle of Web Developement for a few local businesses. I’ll do maybe 2/2.5 hours of this then go to bed. A day well spent and I didn’t need to get up at 5am to do it. So yeah getting up at 5am means that you are productive early in the day but it doesn’t mean that getting up any later will make you less productive. Maybe in the future when me and my boyfriend are living together we can both join the 5am club and make it work. But for now my routine is pretty solid.
