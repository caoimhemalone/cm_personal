                            <p>After 5 years, 3 renewed licenses, 4 tests and many shouting sessions between me and my Mam as she instructed me, I finally passed my driving test. Well, I passed 6 months ago but never got around to writing this blog post so here we go. Passing my driving test has been the biggest struggle in my early 20s. I started my driving lessons in late 2014 when I was 19. I hated going to lessons. I don't know if it was the instructor that I had or if it was the fear of crashing the car but every night before a lesson I wouldn't sleep. The knots in my stomach would be that bad that I would get about 4 hours sleep. Once I was actually driving I was fine but for some reason, the thought of it was nearly making me sick so in turn, I started hating driving. When my Mam would suggest I drive the family out for dinner or down to my Nanny's I would moan and say no you just drive I'm not in the mood. This was my mindset from the very start and probably the reason it took me 5 years to get my full license. I have always been a good driver, I obey the rules of the road, I studied all of the questions you could be asked for hours and hours but I let nerves get the best of me. All of my life I have been bad at taking tests. My teachers in school would tell my Mam that I was bright and good in class but for some reason when it came to the tests I would fall short. I have been that way from day 1 of primary school up until my final year of college I just don't test well. And it's probably down to nerves. In the first driving test I did I thought I did a good job and was surprised when I failed, I blamed the instructor being in a bad mood and kept the attitude that I was a good driver so I kept driving. I got a bit of confidence and drove my family around everywhere so after a few months I decided I'd do the test again. It was a disaster. It was a sunny day so I got really warm and started sweating while I was driving so it made me even more nervous and I made a big mistake in the sweaty state I was in. There was a weird fork in the road and when the instructor said turn right I thought he meant keep right but when I realised what he meant I had to make a quick turn to follow the route he wanted. In doing so I went into 4th gear instead of 2nd gear. The car didn't cut out but it jutted. I closed my eyes for a second and I knew that that was it I had failed. After that mistake it was like the snowball effect I kept making mistake after mistake and I was counting down the minutes until it was over. That driving test really knocked my confidence and put me off driving. A few months later I moved to America for 3 months. When I got back I didn't get into the car again until 5 months later and I didn't keep it up. My dad started working Saturday mornings so our time to go out and drive was limited and I stopped putting the effort in. Fast forward a few months and I had started my final year of college while working a part-time job so any spare time I had was reserved for eating and showering so I told my dad to cancel the insurance all together it was a waste of money. One more move to America for three months, one degree later, 5 more birthdays and I finally passed my driving test. At the beginning of 2019, I did a few extra lessons and another test which I failed but it didn't affect me. My instructor was so angry because he knew I was a good driver and that it was just one mistake that I made that caused the outcome. So instead of my usual shy away, forget about driving and just cycle for the rest of my life I got insured on my Mam's BMW. It is such a nice car to drive and it was modern and sturdy, unlike my dad's little car. I became more confident in my driving and in September 2019 I passed my driving test. It was the greatest achievement of my life which may sound a bit drastic considering it's just driving a car, millions of people do it, but for me, it had been such a struggle, I got knocked down so many times but I finally picked myself back up and passed. I have been driving my Mam's car for the past few months and last week I bought myself a nice 18-2 VW Polo. It's my new baby. But will I still be cycling 100KM a week? I'm a cyclist. I cycle to and from work. I cycle to the gym. I cycle to my friend's houses. I cycle to my boyfriend's house. So now what? Will I stop cycling everywhere? The simple answer is no. I love cycling. I will endure the rainy, cold, windy weather of Dublin and cycle to where I need to go. I love the freedom of no traffic because I can weave in and out of the cars while I laugh at them knowing that they will be stuck in that same spot for 20 minutes with very little progress. I love the rush of pushing my muscles to get me up the hills. The euphoria felt as the hormones flow through my body. I love eating cake at the weekend without feeling guilty because I know I've cycled so much during the week. When my hands are gripping the handlebars I feel like I'm in my happy place. How could I give that up? Yes, now that I can drive I have a lot more freedom and I love knowing that if it's pouring rain I don't have to wear a full-body astronaut suit just to stop myself from getting a cold cycling 20 minutes to the shop, so it's a win-win situation. I can finally drive but I don't have to sacrifice my love for cycling.</p>

                            Everything happens for a reason. I got shit on by a bird this morning. I was awoken this morning like I am every morning of the weekday to the sound of Alexa's voice coming from my Amazon Echo Dot, she was telling me the current weather at 7:09 am. I usually anticipate the rain or the cold and then go back to sleep until 7:30 am but this morning she told me it was -2 degrees Celsius and I got out of bed immediately. There was no way I was getting up at 7:30 and cycling, it would have been too dangerous with the frost on the roads. So, I quickly got dressed, grabbed my toothbrush to brush my teeth in work, as I had no time, and caught my dad before he left for work. I drove with him as far as the North Circular Road and then hopped out at the traffic lights to continue my journey to work ( a 30-minute walk). Just as I turned the corner heading towards the 5 Lamps a bird pooed on me! Luckily, not on my head, it was just on the arm of my coat. It’s meant to be good luck when a bird poos on you but so far my day hasn’t been very lucky it’s been average. I don’t know if I believe in luck. I feel we create our luck ourselves. For instance, when people say; ‘Oh, I was so lucky to get that job’, no you worked hard and built up a portfolio or a skill which in turn helped you get that job. We hate giving ourselves praise (well, most of us) so we play it off like it was nothing that we have done, it was just an accident. We, as humans, shy away from the fact that we could be good or great at something so we label it down to Lady Luck being on our side and hope that we don't mess it up. But in truth, we must have portrayed ourselves well in our job interviews or first dates or presentations to get the job, the relationship or the grade and that doesn't come down to luck it comes down to hard work, which in turn is a reflection of your personality or your skills. I guess I don’t believe in luck because I’m too practical. I think of everything logically. I’m a developer it’s how my brain works. I don’t believe in luck but I do believe in ‘everything happens for a reason’. I do believe that the Universe works in magical ways. If my auntie never bought me that digital camera when I was 12 I would never have brought it to Florida on holidays with me and taken pictures (very very bad ones) and sparked the photography light inside of me. Further on, then I wouldn’t have taken photos on my mam’s iPhone 4s a few years later which led me to post more photography pictures on Instagram which wouldn’t of led me to taking photos in San Francisco and the next trip and the next which wouldn’t of led me to this year actually getting paid to take photos for Bodynamics, a gym nearby. There are so many situations like that in my life that I look back on. What if this never happened or that never happened or what if I did end up going to college in New York for film studies like I was researching at the time, my life would be so much different now. Everything happens for a reason, that’s the good times and the bad it just depends on your outlook on life.

                            With Apple's release of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro this month I thought I’d dive into why I don’t see myself leaving Apple. At 24 I am on iPhone number 4 (iPhone  5, 6, 7, XS), that’s not exactly a high number but every second year since I was 17 I bought a new iPhone and renewed my 2-year contract with Three without hesitation. I have not always paid for my bill so that might have a factor in being able to get a new iPhone every second year. When I was 17 myself and my sister made a presentation on Keynote, sat my parents down and made points as to why they should get us an iPhone (Looking back now it makes us sound so spoiled). My parents were reluctant but we kept persisting we even changed my Mam's lock screen of her iPhone 4 to the new iPhone 5. After we hounded them for months my mam decided that we could get them. Because she was on a work contract she wasn’t paying her phone bill herself so she decided that she would pay for ours instead. She also liked the idea of us never running out of credit in an emergency because it was bill pay we could always call her. I think she paid the few hundred for each phone too. After that we would pay the €300-500 whatever it was for the phone and my mam would pay the bill. Until I got my iPhone XS. I was just graduated from college, in a full-time job and decided to buy myself a Christmas present. I paid around €600 for the phone and for the first time my phone bill myself. And ever since I have never even considered any other brand of phone. So why no matter the cost do I keep going back to Apple again and again? I have the first generation iPad, 2nd gen Apple TV, I had gen 0 Apple Watch and last summer upgraded to gen 4, Airpods 1, I have a 2015 iMac, a dinosaur 2008 iMac (now used mainly as a photos slideshow), I have the 2012 MacBook Pro (extremely slow and only used for Netflix) and recently thanks to my way too generous boyfriend I have the 2018 MacBook Air. This may make me sound like I’m made of money but these were all accumulated over the past 10 years. I like to save up my money to buy expensive technology and I’m an Apple Nerd so I happily give them all of my hard-earned money. But why? Why do I give this trillion-dollar company all of my money? Because I believe in them. I believed in Steve Jobs. He wasn’t perfect by any means but there was a method to his madness. Without him being anal about designs he wouldn’t have revolutionised certain products. Like the swivel neck iMac or the first iPad or how the floors and windows looked in his Apple Stores. I think my belief in what he built and what Apple is today is why I am so blindly devoted to the company. If I hadn’t of been so inspired by Steve Jobs when I was 15 then I probably wouldn’t have gone on to do Computer Science in college and wouldn’t have my career today in Web Development (can you call it a career when you’re only 1 year graduated from college?). If I didn’t mess around in iMovie with my families 2008 iMac I would never have gotten into film editing and photography later on as a hobby. Apple has made me the person that I am. No, seriously, it has. That is why I think I will never veer away from their products. Every time an Android user complains about Apples walled garden I just brush it off and continue to give my support to my favourite company. Every time someone makes a joke about the headphone jack I tell them of how AirPods are the best product that I’ve ever bought and that I’m about to buy my second pair. Every time someone gives out about the price or how Apple is late to the party with some features I know that’s it’s because perfection takes time and that I’d rather pay €1000-2000 for the aluminium to have a long-lasting laptop (my 2012 MacBook Pro is still kicking in her old age). Every time I watch a YouTuber buy a new Windows laptop because Apple took away the ports I know that in a few years those same people will be rocking USB C everything. I believe that they thrive to make the best products that they can without forcing a project out that isn't perfect (cough cough Galaxy Fold) and they give you something that you didn't even realise that you wanted until you had it. The Floppy Disk reader under the screen. A device that allowed you to listen to 1000s of songs and fits in your pocket. A phone with no physical keyboard. A tablet which fit perfectly between your two hands. A laptop that could fit inside an a4 envelope. A watch with a computer inside. A phone with no headphone jack. Wireless earphones. A phone with 2 cameras on the back. A phone with 3 cameras on the back. And that's just the hardware. Apple has given us so many features over the years in their Software that we just wouldn't have used or known that we wanted to use them unless Apple had taken the initiative to give us those features. They know their users so well and in return have so much loyalty from their users. So yes I am probably way too loyal to Apple but I wouldn’t have it any other way. I join countless other people who count down the days to WWDC, who sit outside Apple Stores for days waiting for the new iPhone, who save up all of their extra money to buy the newest Apple Products because we just need to have them! We're Apple fangirls/boys devoted to the company that has touched us all in different ways. The reason why I won't leave them is simple; everything just works.

                            I have had my Apple AirPods V1 for 2 years now (oh so hipster of me I know) and they’re the best thing I never expected to love. I will get into my relationship with my AirPods in another post in a few weeks as I’m thinking about getting the V2 as my current V1 are so full of ear wax that the sound is so low (disgusting I know). So anyway, within the 2 years I have owned the beloved earphones I have also been cycling and have been quite active. I cycle to and from work every day and also to the gym and pretty much anywhere I need to go as I don’t drive. So in a week, I could cycle around 130km and with every cycle, I listen to podcasts. I know you shouldn’t cycle with earphones in but I only put the left one in (the opposite side to traffic in Ireland) and the volume is low enough that I can hear everything around me. It’s just nice to have something to listen to and ponder while I’m on my 40-minute commute. I also believe that you should be learning something new everyday through either reading or audio so you know 2 birds 1 stone and all that. Let’s get down to it, I love my AirPods but I don’t trust them. I have seen many people exercising with them in, whether it’s running, lifting weights or cycling but for me, they aren’t my go-to. When I sweat the AirPods are less secure in my ear, I am constantly adjusting them so in time I just went back to my over the head non-brand wireless headphones I got from Wish (probably the best things I’ve ever bought off of that company). For cycling, I’ve never even tried to use them because if one was to fall out while I was weaving in and out of the Dublin traffic it would be run over or lost down a drain in no time. So my solution at first was these; They’re an around the neck ear cuff accessory for the AirPods. They were £16.99 (in pounds because there is no Irish Amazon site so we have to use the UK one, it’s very annoying) on Amazon (no longer available). You just slip them in the two holders and wrap the cuff around your ear and you’re good. Again, I would only use one and with time and wear and tear my AirPods were getting quieter and quieter and eventually needed to be angled at a certain way for you to hear anything so this accessory no longer met my requirements. After a year of using the ear cuff accessory, I decided to switch it up and I got something that changed the experience I had with my AirPods completely and they’re only £4.49 on Amazon. I bought them on a whim and I have not regretted it. They are something that I could not live without alongside my AirPods. This may all seem very dramatic for a piece of silicon but I absolutely love them. They are simply just silicone covers with ear hooks. These simple little things make it feel as if you have nothing in your ear while giving you the sense of security that no matter what you aren’t going to lose one of your €179+ earphones. I know there is a lot of negativity around AirPod accessories as some people think you shouldn’t have to buy an accessory for them they should just work. And they do. AirPods just works just like your phone it just works but you still aren’t going to walk around with it naked and if you are you’re crazy or have a lot of money. No, you’re going to put a case on your phone which falls under the category of accessory. So, just because a product might require an accessory to better its experience doesn’t make that a bad product. With 2 days left in the month, I currently have 26h 1m and 406.6km done on my Strava. That’s ~26hours this month that I have used these silicon covers alongside my AirPods and I don’t know what I would do without them. They have made my daily commute so much simpler that all I have to do is grab the left AirPod from its case, slip it into the cover, stick it in my ear and go without any worries or adjusting on my ride. So, if you’re an avid AirPods user and are constantly adjusting the position as you walk or exercise I highly recommend buying these covers, for the little cost they make such a difference.

                            This started off as a journal entry but I decided that it was actually a good topic to write about. I’ve been thinking a lot about the 5am club. I’ve heard about it on many podcasts and have read numerous medium articles on the subject. I would 100% join the 5am club instead of staying up until 11:30 doing my side job of web dev or editing a video (which I rarely have time to do anymore). But right now in my life it’s just not ideal to get up at 5am. Yeah it would be great by the time I get into work at 8:30 I can have my gym workout done, a bit of web development done, my breakfast eaten nice and early to get my metabolism going and my 10km cycle to work done. I could have a really productive day before 9am. But there’s just one problem. It would take a huge toll on my relationship with my boyfriend. Our weekdays are so busy that we only get to talk to each other via text in the evening (and then we see each other on the weekend). And even at that the conversation is spread out because we aren’t looking at our phones the whole evening. We don’t live together so it makes catching up on eachothers day a little bit harder. So if I woke up at 5am I would have to go to sleep at 9pm to get my 8 hours sleep ( I need my 8 hours or I can’t function). And I just can’t do that right now. But my current routine does work for me. My Daily (weekday) Routine I wake up at 7:09 am to the sound of Alexa telling me the weather for the day (essential when living in Ireland and cycling to work). Then my alarm goes off at 7:10am indicating that it’s time to get out of bed. I eat a banana, that I bring to my room the night before, and get dressed into my gym/cycling gear. I brush my teeth then go downstairs and grab my lunch from the fridge. I put on everything I need to cycle (jacket, gloves, helmet, turn lights on) then leave the house around 7:30–7:45. I cycle 10km (40minutes) from Santry, Dublin to Leeson Street, Dublin. I get into work (a web development company) for 8:10–8:20, have a shower and get into my work clothes (the typical Developer attire of jeans and a hoodie) then I am at my desk by 8:30/40. Around 9am I will have my porridge (porridge oats, milk, peanut butter, chia seeds, and protein powder) It’s the best porridge ever. Then I work until 5pm. I’m back on the bike at 5:15pm, cycle 8.4km to the gym, do an hours workout, cycle ~2km home, get home around 7:15, have my dinner, shower or have a bath to relax my muscles while I read a book, then some days I sit down at my computer and work on my side hustle of Web Developement for a few local businesses. I’ll do maybe 2/2.5 hours of this then go to bed. A day well spent and I didn’t need to get up at 5am to do it. So yeah getting up at 5am means that you are productive early in the day but it doesn’t mean that getting up any later will make you less productive. Maybe in the future when me and my boyfriend are living together we can both join the 5am club and make it work. But for now my routine is pretty solid.
